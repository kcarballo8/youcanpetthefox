# youcanpetthefox

Please **do not edit** `main` directly. Only _your_ branch, and merge later.

For our first digital prototype, please:
  1) only edit your scene under Assets/Scenes.
  2) ***only edit your branch, and merge to master as often as possible to avoid merge conflicts.***

Again, please **do not edit** `main` directly. Only _your_ branch.
